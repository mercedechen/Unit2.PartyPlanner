# Unit2.PartyPlanner

Your friend is an event organizer and has asked you to build a website for them. They want to be able to keep track of all the parties they are organizing. They want to be able to see a list of all the parties, add new parties, and delete parties.

## Requirements

Build your website according to this user story:

A user enters the website and finds a list of the names, dates, times, locations, and descriptions of all the parties that are happening.
Next to each party in the list is a delete button. The user clicks the delete button for one of the parties. That party is then removed from the list.

There is also a form that allows the user to enter information about a new party that they want to schedule. After filling out the form and submitting it, the user observes their party added to the list of parties.

## Criteria

* Fetch is used correctly to GET party data from the API.
* Fetch is used correctly to POST a new party to the API.
* Fetch is used correctly to DELETE a party from the API.
* The app contains a list of the names, dates, times, locations, and descriptions of all parties.
* Each party in the list has a delete button which removes the party when clicked.
* The app contains a form that allows a user to enter information about a party and add it to the list.
* The DOM is dynamically rendered according to data stored in state.
* The data stored in state is updated to stay in sync with the API.
